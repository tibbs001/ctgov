Interventional: studies in human beings in which individuals are assigned by an investigator based on a protocol to receive specific interventions. Subjects may receive diagnostic, therapeutic or other types of interventions. The assignment of the intervention may or may not be random. The individuals are then followed and biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed.

Observational: studies in human beings in which biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed in pre-defined groups of individuals. Subjects in the study may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the study.


Patient Registry
Definition: For observational studies only, check the Patient Registry box if this record describes a study that is also considered to be a Patient Registry. This type of study should only be registered once in the PRS, by the sponsor responsible for the primary data collection and analysis.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defines a Patient Registry as including an organized system that uses observational methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) prospectively for a population defined by a particular disorder/disease, condition (including susceptibility to a disorder), or exposure (including products, health care services, and/or procedures) and that serves a predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purpose. Patient registries may be single purpose or on-going data collection programs that address one or more questions.


Expanded Access: records describing the procedure for obtaining an experimental drug or device for patients who are not adequately treated by existing therapy, who do not meet the eligibility criteria for enrollment, or who are otherwise unable to participate in a controlled clinical study. Expanded Access records are used to register all types of non-protocol access to experimental treatments, including protocol exception, single-patient IND, treatment IND, compassionate use, emergency use, continued access and parallel track.

In general, supportive care interventions are not intended to cure a disease.

Intervention Model (FDAAA)  (at least one of the following required: Intervention Model, Masking, Allocation. All may be required as part of Study Design under PL 110-85, Section 801) - intervention assignments

    * Single Group: single arm study

    * Parallel: participants are assigned to one of two or more groups in parallel for the duration of the study

    * Single Blind: one party, either the investigator or participant, is unaware of the intervention assignment; also called single-masked study.

    * Double Blind: two or more parties are unaware of the intervention assignment



      If Single Blind or Double Blind is selected, check the role(s) that are to be masked: Subject, Caregiver, Investigator or Outcomes Assessor.

Allocation (FDAAA) (at least one of the following required: Intervention Model, Masking, Allocation. All may be required as part of Study Design under PL 110-85, Section 801) - participant assignment to intervention group



    * N/A: single arm study

    * Nonrandomized Trial: participants are expressly assigned to intervention groups through a non-random method, such as physician choice



Study Classification (formerly Endpoint) - type of primary outcome or endpoint that the protocol is designed to evaluate. Select one.



    * N/A: not applicable

    * Safety: show if the drug is safe under conditions of proposed use

    * Efficacy: measure of an intervention's influence on a disease or health condition

    * Safety/Efficacy

    * Bio-equivalence: scientific basis for comparing generic and brand name drugs

    * Bio-availability: rate and extent to which a drug is absorbed or otherwise available to the treatment site in the body

    * Pharmacokinetics: the action of a drug in the body over a period of time including the process of absorption, distribution and localization in tissue, biotransformation, and excretion of the compound

Pharmacodynamics: action of drugs in living systems

Pharmacokinetics/dynamics



Observational Study Design



Observational Study Model * - primary strategy for subject identification and follow-up. Select one.



Cohort: group of individuals, initially defined and composed, with common characteristics (e.g., condition, birth year), who are examined or traced over a given time period

Case-control: group of individuals with specific characteristics (e.g., conditions or exposures) compared to group(s) with different characteristics, but otherwise similar

Case-only: single group of individuals with specific characteristics

Case-crossover: characteristics of case immediately prior to disease onset (sometimes called the hazard period) compared to characteristics of same case at a prior time (i.e., control period)

Ecologic or community studies: geographically defined populations, such as countries or regions within a country, compared on a variety of environmental (e.g., air pollution intensity, hours of sunlight) and/or global measures not reducible to individual level characteristics (e.g., health care system, laws or policies median income, average fat intake, disease rate)

Family-based: studies conducted among family members, such as genetic studies within families or twin studies and studies of family environment



Other - explain in Detailed Description



Time Perspective * - temporal relationship of observation period to time of subject enrollment. Select one.



Prospective: look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following subject enrollment

Retrospective: look back using observations collected predominantly prior to subject selection and enrollment

Cross-sectional: observations or measurements made at a single point in time, usually at subject enrollment

Other - explain in Detailed Description
